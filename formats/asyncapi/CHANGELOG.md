# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (working draft)

- **Unary publish success is strict 2xx (ASYNC-P-06)**: a 3xx final status is
  now a failure, matching the SSE path's classification.
- **Pooled-WebSocket writes are detached from the invocation context**:
  cancelling one invocation mid-write no longer tears down the shared
  connection for sibling subscriptions.

This release tracks the spec 0.2.0 alignment of `openbindings-go`. The public API breaks from the root SDK (executor → invoker rename, `BindingExecutionInput`/`BindingExecutionSource` → `BindingInvocationInput`/`BindingInvocationSource`, `InvocationOptions` folded into `BindingContext`, `InterfaceClient` removed in favor of codegen-emitted `<Name>Invoker` types, `.Data` event field renamed to `.Output`) propagate to this module's exported surface. See the root `openbindings-go` CHANGELOG for the full table. No format-specific behavior changed.

**Invocation handle migration.** `InvokeBinding` now returns the cardinality-agnostic `Invocation[I, O]` handle (input via `Write`, outputs via `Outputs().Read` to `io.EOF`/terminal) instead of `(<-chan InvocationOutput, error)`. Auth moved off the removed `SecurityMethod`/`ContextStore` path to context (credentials in the binding context; `CONTEXT_REQUIRED` where the source declares requirements). Error codes use the new SCREAMING wire values. See the root CHANGELOG for the full shape.
